An OOP Python implementation of The infamous [Gilded Rose](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata). Below you can read the given feature request.


###### Caveats
I have chosen to not follow the following criteria:
> However, do not alter the Item class or Items property as those belong to the goblin in the corner who will insta-rage
and one-shot you as he doesn't believe in shared code ownership (you can make the UpdateQuality method and Items
property static if you like, we'll cover for you).
